Problem Statement
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women, accounting for nearly 1 in 3 cancers diagnosed among women in the United States, and it is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. Breast Cancer occurs as a result of abnormal growth of cells in the breast tissue, commonly referred to as a Tumor. A tumor does not mean cancer - tumors can be benign (not cancerous), pre-malignant (pre-cancerous), or malignant (cancerous). Tests such as MRI, mammogram, ultrasound, and biopsy are commonly used to diagnose breast cancer performed.

Expected outcome
Given breast cancer results from breast fine-needle aspiration (FNA) test (is a quick and simple procedure to perform, which removes some fluid or cells from a breast lesion or cyst (a lump, sore, or swelling) with a fine needle similar to a blood sample needle). Since this build a model that can classify a breast cancer tumor using two training classification:

1 = Malignant (Cancerous) - Present
0 = Benign (Not Cancerous) -Absent
Data Source
The Breast Cancer datasets is available as machine learning repository maintained by the University of California, Irvine. The dataset contains 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells.
